Important conclusion:
> unsupervised models without conditioning in the latent space are in general unidentifiable.

> In the following, we analyse our algorithm separately
for the general case, and for conditionally exponential
independent components of low order k. The fundamental result is that for sufficiently complex source
distributions, the independent components are estimated up to component-wise nonlinear transformations; if the data comes from an exponential family
of low order, there is an additional linear transformation that remains to be determined (by linear ICA, for
example).
