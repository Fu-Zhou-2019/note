**[Jensen's Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality)**

$$
\phi (E[X]) \le E[\phi(X)]
$$

if $$\phi$$ is a convex function, a simple example:  X~U(0,1) and $$\phi(x) = x^{2}$$.

**[Conjugate prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior)**

A conjugate prior is an algebraic convenience, giving a closed-form expression for the posterior; otherwise numerical integration may be necessary. Further, conjugate priors may give intuition, by more transparently showing how a likelihood function updates a prior distribution.All members of the exponential family have conjugate priors.
