**[Reducing Class Collapse in Metric Learning with Easy Positive Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05162.pdf)**

- theoretically prove and empirically show that under reasonable
noise assumptions, prevalent embedding losses in metric learning, e.g., triplet loss,
tend to project all samples of a class with various modes onto a single point in
the embedding space, resulting in class collapse that usually renders the space illsorted for classification or retrieval.
