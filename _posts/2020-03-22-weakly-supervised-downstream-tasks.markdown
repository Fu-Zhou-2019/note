## Weakly-supervised object detection

#### [Adversarial Complementary Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Localization(CVPR18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06962): an intuitive,simple,elegant way to do adversarial erasing, but only focused on simple dataset: ILSVRC, Caltech256 and CUB-200-2011(mostly contain single object per image). How about three classifiers? can the performance be further boosted?

#### Evaluating Weakly Supervised Object Localization Methods Right(CVPR20): this task is ill.

## Weakly-supervised image segmentation

## co-segmentation, co-detection

## (multiple images) common-object localization

#### [Co-localization in Real-World Images(CVPR14)](http://vision.stanford.edu/pdf/tang14.pdf)
