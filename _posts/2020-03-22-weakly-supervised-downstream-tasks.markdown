## Weakly-supervised object detection

#### [Adversarial Complementary Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Localization(CVPR18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06962): an intuitive,simple,elegant way to do adversarial erasing, but only focused on simple dataset: ILSVRC, Caltech256 and CUB-200-2011(mostly contain single object per image). How about three classifiers? can the performance be further boosted?

#### [Evaluating Weakly Supervised Object Localization Methods Right(CVPR20)](https://github.com/clovaai/wsolevaluation): this task is ill.

## Weakly-supervised image segmentation

For a quicker understanding of this topic, check this survey-style paper [A Comprehensive Analysis of Weakly-Supervised Semantic
Segmentation in Different Image Domains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11186.pdf).

#### (SEC)Seed, expand and constrain: Three principles for weakly-supervised image segmentation(ECCV16)

#### Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Network with Deep Seeded Region Growing(CVPR18)

Deep seeded region growing(DSRG) and Boundary loss. see Fig 2. similar work to SEC.
